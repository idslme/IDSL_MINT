## Criteria of the .xlsx file with SMILES to generate standard .msp files
# 1. A column for dash-seperated fingerprints or InChI/SMILES must be stored in separate rows in an .xlsx file
# 2. .xlsx file must have column headers
# 3. The header of the fingerprints, SMILES, and InChI columns must be identical to 'FINGERPRINT', 'SMILES', and 'INCHI', respectively.
# 4. Other columns are also exported in the same MSP block if present
# 5. A column with header of 'Name' is recommended to be present in the .xlsx file.

  Minimum m/z: 50
  Maximum m/z: 1000
  Interval m/z: 0.01 # This parameters is also used as a maximum mass deviation parameter
  
  Fingerprints:
    ## Only one method can be True and other options must be set to False
    Use fingerprint row entries in the MSP blocks: False # If you have row entries of dash-separated bit location fingerprints in your MSP blocks (e.g. a row entry like --> `Fingerprints: 2-11-20-36-960`)
    ## Below fingerprint modules require InChI or SMILES column entries be present in the .xlsx spreadsheet
